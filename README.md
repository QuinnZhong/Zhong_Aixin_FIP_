#  Final Integrated Project - Brand Mashup

The goal of this Final Integrated Project (FIP) is for each student to work collaboratively
(GROUPS OF TWO) or individually on a project with specifically defined deliverables. These
deliverables will be based on current industry standards and will also follow an
industry-standard workflow.

## Assignment Requirements

* The bottles you choose to build using 3D will have significance because their very
shape, colour and style may help to reflect your brand identity features of your
chosen product.

* 3D models of bottles are a required component of this assignment.

* All photographs and/or assets used for any and all visualizations MUST be taken by
the group. - Some allowances will be made. Please address any
questions/concerns toward your MMED-1057 instructor for specific information
pertaining to the use of stock imagery/assets for your FIP.
* The label design(s) and label/logo design(s) for this new brand MUST be generated
using Illustrator, as this would be the industry standard process. All Illustrator
artwork MUST be submitted as Outlined Artwork, CMYK and saved as Legacy

* Each video/animated piece submitted MUST be less than 100mb.
* All photography needs to be optimized and sized to the final display area it will
occupy within the website, video or package design piece
